## Penguins data

Data on 344 penguins near Palmer Station, Antarctica. Variables include:

* `species`: penguin's species (Adelie, Chinstrap, Gentoo)
* `island`: island where penguin measured (Biscoe, Dream, Torgersen)
* `bill_length_mm`: penguin's bill length (mm)
* `bill_depth_mm`: penguin's bill depth (mm)
* `flipper_length_mm`: penguin's flipper length (mm)
* `body_mass_g`: penguin's body mass (g)
* `sex`: penguin's sex (female, male)
* `year`: year when data recorded (2007, 2008, 2009)

.question[
We get this data set -- where do we start?
]

---

## Starting points for data analysis

* Work with a smaller, manageable subset of the data
* Plots, summary statistics, and missing data
* Create new variables

.pull-right[
* part of the tidyverse

## Making a subset of the data

.question[
We have three species of penguin (Adelie, Chinstrap, Gentoo). Let's make a subset with just the Chinstrap penguins.
]

--

**Step 1:** What data do I start with?

```{r}
penguins
```

.question[
We have three species of penguin (Adelie, Chinstrap, Gentoo). Let's make a subset with just the Chinstrap penguins.
]

**Step 2:** What do I do to that data?

```{r}
penguins %>%
  filter(species == "Chinstrap")
```

**Step 2:** What do I do to that data?

```{r, eval=F}
penguins %>%
  filter(species == "Chinstrap")
```

* `%>%` is called the *pipe*. It means "take `<this>`, THEN do `<that>`"
* `filter` keeps only the rows which satisfy a specific condition

]

**Step 3:** What do I do with the result?

```{r, eval = F}
chinstrap_penguins <- penguins %>% 
  filter(species == "Chinstrap")
```

* `<-` is the *assignment* operator. It means "save the result in R"
  * Here we create a new data frame called `chinstrap_penguins` that contains just the Chinstraps

## Calculating summary statistics

.question[
What is the average body mass for Chinstrap penguins?

```{r}
chinstrap_penguins
```

What is the average body mass for Chinstrap penguins?
]

**Step 2:** What do I do to that data?

```{r}
chinstrap_penguins %>%
  summarize(avg_mass = mean(body_mass_g))
```

* `%>%` is called the *pipe*. It means "take `<this>`, THEN do `<that>`"
* `summarize` is used to calculate summary statistics

---

## Calculating summary statistics

.question[
What is the average body mass for Chinstrap penguins?
]

**Step 3:** (optional) Do I want to save the result?

```{r}
chinstrap_summary <- chinstrap_penguins %>%
  summarize(avg_mass = mean(body_mass_g))

chinstrap_summary
```

---

### Chaining pipes together

If we don't care about the intermediate results, we can chain pipes (`%>%`) together. These two chunks calculate the same summary statistics.


**Option 1:**

```{r, eval=F}
chinstrap_penguins <- penguins %>%
  filter(species == "Chinstrap")

chinstrap_penguins %>%
  summarize(avg_mass = mean(body_mass_g))
```


**Option 2:**

```{r, eval=F}
penguins %>%
  filter(species == "Chinstrap") %>%
  summarize(avg_mass = mean(body_mass_g))
```

---

## Calculating summary statistics

.question[
What if I want the average body mass for Adelie penguins?
]

```{r, eval=F}
penguins %>%
  filter(species == "Chinstrap") %>%
  summarize(avg_mass = mean(body_mass_g))
```

---

## Calculating summary statistics

.question[
What if I want the average body mass for Adelie penguins?
]

```{r, eval=F}
penguins %>%
  filter(species == "Adelie") %>%
  summarize(avg_mass = mean(body_mass_g))
```

---

## Calculating summary statistics

.question[
What is the average body mass for Adelie penguins?
]

```{r}
penguins %>%
  filter(species == "Adelie") %>%
  summarize(avg_mass = mean(body_mass_g))
```

.question[
What does a result of `NA` mean?
]

--

* `NA` means "Not Available"
* We get `NA` when there are missing values

---

## Handling missing values

.question[
What is the average body mass for Adelie penguins?
]

**Option 1:**

```{r}
penguins %>%
  filter(species == "Adelie") %>%
  summarize(avg_mass = mean(body_mass_g,
                            na.rm=TRUE))
```

* Use `filter` to focus only on Adelie penguins
* `summarize` is used to calculate summary statistics
* `na.rm=TRUE` means "ignore missing values"

---

## Handling missing values

.question[
What is the average body mass for Adelie penguins?
]

**Option 2:**

```{r}
penguins %>%
  filter(species == "Adelie") %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  summarize(avg_mass = mean(body_mass_g))
```

* `drop_na` means "remove any rows with missing values in any columns"

---

## Handling missing values

```{r, eval=F}
penguins %>%
  filter(species == "Adelie") %>%
  summarize(avg_mass = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm=TRUE))
```

`3701.`

```{r, eval=F}
penguins %>%
  filter(species == "Adelie") %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  summarize(avg_mass = mean(body_mass_g))
```

`3706.`

.question[
Why do these chunks give different numbers?
]

---

## Handling missing values

* `drop_na` removes *all* rows with missing values (not just missing values in `body_mass_g`)
* Reasonable if this is a small number of rows
* When you have missing values, check how much data is missing

---

## Calculating summary statistics

.question[
What is the average body mass for *each* species of penguin?
]

--

```{r}
penguins %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  summarize(avg_mass = mean(body_mass_g,
                            na.rm=T))
```

--

* `group_by` is used to group rows together
* We often use `group_by` before `summarize`

---

## Calculating summary statistics

.question[
What is the mean and standard deviation of body mass, for each species and sex?
]

```{r}
penguins %>%
  group_by(species, sex) %>%
  summarize(avg_mass = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm=T),
            sd_mass = sd(body_mass_g, na.rm=T))
```

---

## Calculating summary statistics

.question[
How many penguins of each species and sex are there?
]

```{r}
penguins %>%
  count(species, sex)
```

---

## Starting points for data analysis

* Work with a smaller, manageable subset of the data
* Plots, summary statistics, and missing data
* Create new variables

---

## Creating new variables

.question[
What's the distribution of the ratio of body mass to flipper length?
]

--

**Step 1:** Create a new variable

```{r, eval=F}
penguins %>%
  mutate(body_flipper_ratio = flipper_length_mm/body_mass_g)
```

```{r, output.lines=2:10, echo=F, message=F, warning=F}
penguins %>%
  mutate(body_flipper_ratio = flipper_length_mm/body_mass_g) %>%
  select(species, island, body_mass_g, flipper_length_mm, body_flipper_ratio)
```

---

## Creating new variables

.question[
What's the distribution of the ratio of body mass to flipper length?
]

**Step 1:** Create a new variable

```{r, eval=F}
penguins %>%
  mutate(body_flipper_ratio = flipper_length_mm/body_mass_g)
```

* `mutate` creates a new column in your dataset

---

## Creating new variables

.question[
What's the distribution of the ratio of body mass to flipper length?
]

**Step 2:** Save the data with the new column

```{r, eval=F}
penguins_new <- penguins %>%
  mutate(body_flipper_ratio = flipper_length_mm/body_mass_g)
```

---

## Creating new variables

.question[
What's the distribution of the ratio of body mass to flipper length?
]

**Step 3:** Exploratory data analysis

```{r}
penguins_new <- penguins %>%
  mutate(body_flipper_ratio = flipper_length_mm/body_mass_g)

penguins_new %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  summarize(mean_ratio = mean(body_flipper_ratio, na.rm=T))
```

  * `filter`
* Plots, summary statistics, and missing data
  * `summarize`, `group_by`, `count`, `drop_na`
